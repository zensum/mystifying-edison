# Mystifying Edison

Welcome to this code test provided by Zensum!

This project is supposed to be a web app to display posts and the user who posted them,
however it is riddled with bugs and it is your task to improve this page.

## Quick start

First of all, clone this project or just download the zipped version.

Second, make sure you have a relatively modern version of node installed. This is
tested with node `v11.10.1`, `v10.15.1` and `v8.15.1`. There should be both a yarn and npm lockfile checked in.

Head into your local copy and either run

`npm install` + `npm run start`

or

`yarn` + `yarn start`

This will start the dev server in a browser window.

## Tasks

There are 3 types of tasks and they range from small to large in size.
The three categories are `bug`, `feature` and `creative`.

* `Bug #1 - small`

  When the page is loaded you are presented with an empty search-box, but no posts.
  When investigating in the console there is a cryptic error `TypeError: posts.filter is not a function`.
  Your task is to find out what is going on and get the posts to show.

* `Bug #2 - small/medium`

  The back-end team has complained a bit over the large amount of request to their servers.
  It seems that a new request to load all the posts is fired whenever a user types something in the search box.
  Find a way to make the app go easier on the service.

* `Feature #1 - small`

  The scoping gods have decreed that the post list must be sorted and neat at all times.
  Your task is to sort the posts alphabetically by title.

* `Feature #2 - small/medium`

  Apparently the original creator of this site had an extra-vagant taste in alient fonts,
  and the designers have had enough. After a bit of searching the design team has found a suiting font;
  `IBM Plex Sans`, which can be found over at [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

* `Feature #3 - large`

  People are getting confused about who posted which posts, and just displaying the user id
  on the post isn't helping. Find a way to display the username on the post instead of the user id.

* `Creative`

  Someone left in a rush and didn't finish the user page. This is now your task and you are
  given free reigns on all design choices. Make it however you want it, be creative.
